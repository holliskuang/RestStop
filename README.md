<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This Folder comes with a RestStop Application Executable packaged for Windows at the root folder. If you are running Windows, you may choose to open the app through this executable. Otherwise, you can build the app tailored to your operating system. 

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/holliskuang/RestStop.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Test and Start the App locally
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```
4. If you are interested in turning the app into an executable, you can utilize electron-builder to package the app
  ```sh
  npm run packager
  ```
